How-\never, identifying the malicious smart IoT device and taking\nthe necessary action on time to protect the overall network\nis important. Simultaneously recording this information trans-\nparently to alert others (i.e., military units) in the network\nis also required. In this context, this paper proposes a three-\nlayered architecture called TSBT that uses blockchain and\ncybersecurity technologies. The first layer consists of smart\nIoT devices and a gateway to capture battlefield information\nand provide it to the gateway. The gateway utilizes this\ninformation and passes it to the robust IDS to identify the\nmalicious smart IoT devices if they exist. The second layer\ncontains a blockchain network and swarm, designed by the\ncommand center to transparently record the information of\nmalicious smart IoT devices to alert military units. The third\nlayer consists of smart contracts as DApps for the military\nunits to perform various operations using smart contract logic.\nFurther, three smart contracts are presented to register smart\nIoT devices, record the details of malicious smart IoT devices,\nand change the updated IP information on the blockchain\nnetwork. Further, a scenario is designed to elaborate on the\nworkings of the proposed framework. In the future, we will\nimplement the proposed framework on the layer-2 blockchain\nto utilize this model to benefit society.",

In [9], authors presented the concept and practical\ntechniques useful in creating and designing decentralized cy-\nbersecurity software using Blockchain (i.e., book chapters). In\n[10], authors proposed a Blockchain-based solution for secure\ncommunication in the BoT ecosystem using Blockchain and\ncybersecurity. In [11], authors focused on security challenges\nof the Blockchain-IoT ecosystem through applicable use cases.\nThey also provided insight into the Blockchain platforms,\nincluding Ethereum, Hyperledger, and IOTA, to exhibit their\nrespective challenges, constraints, and prospects regarding\nperformance and scalability. In [12], authors proposed a three-\ntier architecture for the BoT network containing an application\nand service layer, a network and cybersecurity layer, and\na battlefield layer. Further, they implemented CNN-YOLO-\nbased target detection and formulated information security and\nprivacy policies to maintain algorithmic data access and autho-\nrization. In [14], authors proposed an IoT framework named\nIoBTChain using Blockchain and smart contracts. Further,\na credit-based resource management system is designed for\nthe Integration Framework of Internet of Battlefield Things\n(IoBT) to control the quantity of resources obtained from the\ncloud server based on some predetermined condition. In [7],\nauthors proposed a robust IDS that utilizes low-level system\ninformation to learn the pattern of device behaviour. So that, it\ncan easily differentiate between legit and malicious events. In\n[23], authors introduced a Passban IDS model that is based on\nintelligent anomaly enabled IDS leveraging edge computing to\naddress IoT devices vulnerabilities. In [21], authors focused on\nrecent studies to detect cyber attacks using ML based IDS.\nThey discussed the trend of integrating ML into NIDS to\nimprove the quality of cyber attack detection.",

All these things are possible only because of the data and its related science. With the \nhelp of the data and its related science, it is easy to collect, accumulate, administer, and analyze a huge \nvolume of data collected from various sensors and devices, with the help of IoT (Demirkan, Demirkan, \n& McKee, 2020). In this process, a huge number of self-functioning systems and devices are connected \nthrough internet technology and thereby synchronize their activities. Still, data security and solitude for \nthe substantial number of data systems within the IoT have become a question mark. As, IoT collects \nhuge volumes of assorted data from various sources with numerous devices, conventional data and cyber \nsecurity methods such as encryption are not competent to safeguard the IoT and data systems. Hence to \nensure efficient cybersecurity, more number of researches has been happening in recent times to examine \nthe developments happening in data science for protecting such systems (Sarker, 2020). As a result, a \nnew technology called blockchain has developed and it plays a major role as expected, in safeguarding \ndata science and ensuring cybersecurity, and the same has been elucidated as follows;",

      "section_title": "The ultimate objective of Blockchain technology is to ensure secured business transactions, especially in \nthe case of the cryptocurrency business. As data security is at the forefront of this technology, it reached \nall the spheres of the business easily. With this backdrop, this section presents various applications of \nblockchain technology in cybersecurity (Zhuang, Zamir & Liang, 2020). There are four areas identified \nbased on the blockchain-enabled security such as distributed ledger, IoT security, Domain Name System, \nand end-to-end encryption. As mentioned earlier, centralized data storage is not safe due to single point \nauthorization, as it is having the possibility of massive errors. To replace the same issue, this technology \nuses the component called distributed ledger process, through this data can be managed in a decentralized \nmanner and disseminated among numerous devices. With the help of distributed ledger architecture, \nblockchains enabled decentralized data storage, and also use Cryptographic checksums to make sure data \nsecurity. The second area where this technology ensures security is IoT, as it is having association with \nnumerous connected devices, and cybersecurity is a must for this case. Hence, blockchain technologies \ncan be used to ensure secure data transfer between the systems and not have centralized control. Domain \nName Systems (DNS) are typically functioning under a centralized controlling setup and it would be \neasy for the hackers to break the system and steal the data easily without complexity (Parizi, Dehghan-\ntanha, Azmoodeh & Choo, 2020). On the other hand blockchain technology facilitates distributed nature \ndata storage, and it would be a challenge for the hackers to find out the place where the data is stored \nexactly, and it is more complicated to discover the point of entry. Thus the data can be safe and without \nany manipulation. In recent times all the applications are using more number of messaging services, for \nthe same they are using the end-to-end encryption, to ensure secured data transfer. For the same, this",
